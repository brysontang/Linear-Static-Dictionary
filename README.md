# Data Setup

1. Clone or download the data from [ARC-AGI repository](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI)
2. Copy the `data` folder from the downloaded repository to the root level of this project
3. The final structure should look like:
   ```
   project_root/
   ├── data/         # Data folder from ARC-AGI
   ├── .gitignore
   └── README.md
   ```

Note: The `data` folder is already included in `.gitignore` to prevent committing large data files.
